Carefully analyze the entire existing project, including all files, folders, inline comments, and the Current Architecture Overview document.

Before making any changes, you MUST:
- Confirm the application is fully working in its current deployed state on Replit
- Understand the full Contributor → Verifier workflow as defined in the PRD
- Identify the existing Farmer (Contributor) land input form and how land area data currently flows to the Verifier section

Objective:
Implement a GIS-based land measurement feature ONLY for the Farmer (Contributor) land registration flow, inspired by the provided GIS reference (Tap → Trace → Done polygon-based mapping).

Functional requirements (strictly scoped to Farmer → Verifier flow):
1. Farmer (Contributor) Flow:
   - Replace or enhance the manual land-area input with a GIS-based interface
   - Allow the farmer to:
     - Tap / trace land boundaries on a map (polygon drawing)
     - Automatically calculate land area from the drawn polygon
   - Display the calculated area clearly to the farmer
   - Preserve the existing flow and submission logic

2. Data Propagation:
   - The GIS-calculated land area and boundary data must be passed forward using the existing project data flow
   - No changes to how other data fields behave
   - The GIS-calculated area becomes the authoritative land area value

3. Verifier Flow:
   - Surface the GIS-calculated land area and boundary visualization in the Verifier section
   - Verifiers must be able to view (read-only) the mapped land and calculated area
   - No manual recalculation or editing by the Verifier
   - This serves as Two-Factor Verification – Part 1 as defined in the PRD

Strict constraints (DO NOT VIOLATE):
- Do NOT change the existing folder structure
- Do NOT modify routing, authentication, authorization, or role-based access logic
- Do NOT alter dashboards, marketplace, explorer, admin, buyer, or verifier workflows beyond displaying the GIS result
- Do NOT refactor or rewrite unrelated components
- Do NOT break or replace existing manual fallback behavior unless explicitly necessary
- Do NOT change database schema unless absolutely required for storing GIS output
- Preserve all existing UI, logic, and behavior outside the Farmer land form exactly as-is

Allowed changes:
- Modify only the Farmer (Contributor) land registration form and its immediate supporting logic
- Add isolated GIS-related components or utilities if required
- Wire GIS-calculated output into existing verification and review views
- Use defensive handling so failures do not impact other flows

Governance & Safety Rule:
If any required change would impact other modules, roles, or system behavior:
STOP and report the issue instead of making changes.

Goal:
Integrate a GIS-based land measurement system into the Farmer land registration flow and surface the calculated area to Verifiers, while keeping the rest of the project fully intact, stable, and production-safe.
